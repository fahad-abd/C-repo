 * Description: Custom cos funtion using Taylor series expansion upto 0.0001% accuracy.
 *              0.0001% accuracy means the adding should stop if adding makes only 0.0001% change
 *              in return value
 *
 * note: as per my research, taylor series needs to finds very very large factorials and power values.
 *       so i did find that instead of calc fact and pow we just need to find next term using
 *       current term. like this
 *          nthTerm = perviusTerm * -1*x^2 / (2n)(2n-1) for nth term
 *       also since cos repeats itself after 2pi we can get moduls of it for easy calc
